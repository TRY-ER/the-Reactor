0,1,Synthesis/Combination Reaction,Two or more reactants combine to form a single product,A + B → AB,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A synthesis (or combination) reaction involves two or more simple substances combining to form a more complex compound, typically represented as \( A + B \rightarrow AB \). This type of reaction is characterized by multiple reactants yielding a single product. An example is the formation of iron(II) sulfide from iron and sulfur:

\[ 8 \text{Fe} + \text{S}_8 \rightarrow 8 \text{FeS} \]

Another example includes the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gases to produce water. Synthesis reactions are vital for forming complex molecules from simpler ones and are represented visually among four basic chemical reaction types: synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, and double replacement."
1,2,Decomposition Reaction,A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances,AB → A + B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A decomposition reaction involves a complex substance breaking down into simpler components, essentially the reverse of a synthesis reaction. It is represented as \( AB \rightarrow A + B \). An example is the electrolysis of water, where water (\(2H_2O\)) decomposes into oxygen (\(O_2\)) and hydrogen gas (\(2H_2\))."
2,3,Single Displacement/Substitution,A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound,A + BC → AC + B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In a single displacement reaction, an uncombined element replaces another in a compound, effectively exchanging places with an element within the compound. The general form of this reaction is \( A + BC \rightarrow AC + B \). An example is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water, forming solid magnesium hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas: \( \text{Mg} + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Mg(OH)}_2 + \text{H}_2 \)."
3,4,Double Displacement/Substitution,Two compounds exchange ions to produce two new compounds,AB + CD → AD + CB,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Double Displacement Reaction Summary:

In a double displacement reaction, the anions and cations of two compounds exchange places, resulting in the formation of two new compounds. The general form is: 

\[ AB + CD \rightarrow AD + CB \]

**Example 1:** When barium chloride (BaCl₂) reacts with magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄), the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) exchanges with two chloride ions (2Cl⁻), forming barium sulfate (BaSO₄) and magnesium chloride (MgCl₂).

**Example 2:** The reaction of lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO₃)₂) with potassium iodide (2KI) produces lead(II) iodide (PbI₂) and potassium nitrate (2KNO₃).

Key Reaction: 
\[ \text{Pb(NO}_3\text{)}_2 + 2 \text{KI} \rightarrow \text{PbI}_2 \downarrow + 2 \text{KNO}_3 \]

This type of reaction is characterized by the formation of a precipitate and is critical in various chemical applications and analyses."
4,5,Combustion Reaction,"A substance reacts with oxygen, releasing energy as heat and light",CₓHᵧ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + energy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In a combustion reaction, an element or compound reacts with an oxidant, typically oxygen, producing energy as heat or light. Combustion commonly involves hydrocarbons. For example, the combustion of 1 mole (114 g) of octane (\( \text{C}_8\text{H}_{18} \)) in oxygen releases 5500 kJ and results in carbon dioxide and water: 

\[ \text{C}_8\text{H}_{18(l)} + \frac{25}{2} \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 8 \text{CO}_2(g) + 9 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \]

Other elements like carbon, magnesium, and sulfur can also undergo combustion:

\[ 2 \text{Mg}(s) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO}(s) \]

\[ \text{S}(s) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{SO}_2(g) \]"
5,6,Acid-Base/Neutralization,An acid reacts with a base to produce salt and water,Acid + Base → Salt + Water,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory, an acid-base reaction involves the transfer of protons (H⁺) from an acid to a base. The acid loses a proton to form its conjugate base, while the base gains a proton to form its conjugate acid. The reaction is reversible, maintaining equilibrium determined by the acid and base dissociation constants (Kₐ and Kᵦ). A special case of this is neutralization, where equal amounts of acid and base form a neutral salt. 

A strong acid and a strong base, such as HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq) will react to form a neutral solution since the conjugate partners produced are of negligible strength:
HCl(aq)+NaOH(aq)⇌NaCl(aq)+H2O(l)

Write the balanced chemical equation for the neutralization of HCl with Mg(OH)2.  Hint: neutralization reactions are a specialized type of double replacement reaction.  

       2HCl + Mg(OH)2 →  Mg(Cl)2  + 2H2O

Since HCl is a strong acid and Mg(OH)2 is a strong base, the resulting solution would be neutral."
6,7,Precipitation Reaction,An insoluble solid (precipitate) forms when two aqueous solutions are mixed,AB + CD → AD(s) + BC,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A precipitation reaction involves forming a solid in a solution or within another solid during a chemical reaction, occurring when ion concentrations surpass the solubility limit, resulting in an insoluble salt. This reaction can be facilitated by adding a precipitating agent or removing the solvent. Rapid processes yield amorphous or microcrystalline residues, while slower ones produce single crystals, which can also form via recrystallization from microcrystalline salts.

A double replacement reaction is specifically classified as a precipitation reaction when the chemical equation in question occurs in aqueous solution and one of the of the products formed is insoluble. An example of a precipitation reaction is given below:

CdSO4(aq)+K2S(aq)→CdS(s)+K2SO4(aq)
 

Both reactants are aqueous and one product is solid. Because the reactants are ionic and aqueous, they dissociate and are therefore soluble. However, there are six solubility guidelines used to predict which molecules are insoluble in water. These molecules form a solid precipitate in solution."
7,8,Redox/Oxidation-Reduction,Oxidation and reduction occur together (electron transfer),Oxidation/Reduction,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions involve the transfer of electrons, where one species acts as a reducing agent and another as an oxidizing agent, resulting in changes in oxidation states. In the given reaction, hazardous sodium metal reacts with chlorine gas to form sodium chloride. Sodium is oxidized, losing an electron and increasing its oxidation state from 0 to +1, while chlorine is reduced, gaining an electron and decreasing its oxidation state from 0 to -1. Here, sodium acts as the reducing agent and chlorine as the oxidizing agent. This reaction exemplifies the core concepts of redox processes, with electron transfer leading to compound formation."
8,9,Addition Reaction,Two or more molecules combine to form a larger molecule (adduct),A=B + C → A-B-C,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"When an unsaturated hydrocarbon combines with another substance to form a single product, the reaction is termed as an addition reaction. Addition reactions are undergone by all alkenes and alkynes containing either a double bond or a triple bond.

Example: When ethene (C two H four) reacts with hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst, ethane is formed. Addition of hydrogen converts the unsaturated hydrocarbon having a double bond to a saturated hydrocarbon comprising a single bond.

Let us look at the chemical equation of the addition reaction:

C H 2 = C H 2 + H 2 -> C H 3 - C H 3"
9,10,Elimination Reaction,Two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one- or two-step mechanism,A-B-C → A=B + C,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"### Elimination Reaction Summary

**Reaction Type:** Elimination Reaction

Elimination reactions are processes that transform organic molecules by removing substituents, forming multiple bonds such as double or triple bonds. This involves the elimination of a leaving group and typically requires a base. 

In these reactions, two atoms or groups are removed from a molecule without being substituted by other atoms or groups. A new carbon-carbon double bond is formed between the carbon atoms to which the eliminated atoms or groups were previously attached. It is always accompanied by a change in hybridization.

Example: C H 3 - C H 2 - C H 2 - B r (Bromopropane) -> C H 3 - C H = C H 2 (Propene) + K B r + H 2 O"
10,11,Substitution Reaction,One functional group is replaced by another,A-B + C → A-C + B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A substitution reaction is a reaction in which one or more atoms replace another atom or group of atoms in a molecule. Alkyl halides are formed by the substitution of a halogen atom for a hydrogen atom. When methane reacts with chlorine gas, ultraviolet light can act as a catalyst for the reaction:

C H 4 (g) + C l 2 (g) -> U V light -> C H 3 C l (g) + H C l (g)

The reaction produces chloromethane and hydrogen chloride. When the mixture is allowed to react for longer periods of time further, substitution reactions may occur.

C H 3 C l (g) + C l 2 (g) -> U V light -> C H 2 C l 2 (g) + H C l (g)

The product above is dichloromethane. Further substitution produces trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane, commonly called carbon tetrachloride. A mixture of products occurs in the reaction, with the relative amounts dependent upon the time that the reaction is allowed to proceed. Chlorofluorocarbons are produced by reacting chloroalkanes with hydrofluoric acid (H F), because the fluorine atom bonds preferentially to the carbon.

C C l 4 (g) + H F (g) -> F e B r 3 -> C C l 3 F (g) + H C l (g)

The fluorine atom substitutes for a chlorine atom in the reaction."
11,12,Pericyclic Reaction,Concerted reactions involving cyclic transition states,Cyclic mechanism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Pericyclic reactions are a class of organic reactions characterized by concerted cyclic movements of electrons. A key type is cycloaddition, where two or more double bond-containing molecules form a cyclic structure. An important example is the Diels–Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition, involving a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to produce a substituted cyclohexene. These transformations are noteworthy for their stereospecificity and the construction of complex cyclic systems, making them valuable for synthesis in organic chemistry."
12,13,Rearrangement Reaction,Atoms or groups migrate within a molecule to form structural isomers,A-B-C → A-C-B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A rearrangement reaction is a broad class of organic reactions characterized by a ""change of connectivity"" within a molecule. Typically intramolecular, these reactions often involve the movement of a substituent, such as in a 1,2-shift, where a group moves from one atom to an adjacent atom. An example includes the skeletal isomerization of n-butane to isobutane and pentane to isopentane. Common rearrangements include the Wagner–Meerwein and Beckmann rearrangements."
13,14,Photochemical Reaction,Reactions initiated or driven by light energy,A + hν → B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Photochemical reactions involve atoms or molecules absorbing photons from light to reach an excited state. This surplus energy can break chemical bonds, forming radicals. Types include hydrogen-oxygen reactions, radical polymerization, chain reactions, and rearrangement reactions.

A notable example is photosynthesis, where solar energy converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen. Other applications include human vision, driven by the photochemical reaction of rhodopsin, and bioluminescence in fireflies triggered by an enzyme. Significant atmospheric photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry.

Examples:

Photosynthesis: 6 CO2 + 6 H2O, with sunlight, yields C6H12O6 + 6 O2.

Decomposition of Silver Chloride: 2 AgCl, with sunlight, yields 2 Ag + Cl2.

Decomposition of Silver Bromide: 2 AgBr, with sunlight, yields 2 Ag + Br 2."
14,15,Diels-Alder Reaction,Cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and dienophile to form cyclohexene derivative,[4+2] cycloaddition,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"**Diels-Alder Reaction Summary:**

The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile, forming a substituted cyclohexene. This pericyclic reaction involves the interaction of pi orbitals forming new sigma bonds, leading to a cyclohexene derivative. The mechanism displays electron flow from the diene to the dienophile, resulting in a cyclic product. The orbital overlap illustration emphasizes the interaction between the p-orbitals of the diene and the dienophile's unsaturated system, transitioning to sp³ orbitals in the product. This reaction is stereospecific and concerted, meaning it occurs in a single step without intermediates, crucial for synthesizing complex cyclic structures in organic chemistry."
15,16,Olefin Metathesis,Exchange of double bonds between carbon atoms in alkenes,R₁-CH=CH-R₂ + R₃-CH=CH-R₄ → R₁-CH=CH-R₃ + R₂-CH=CH-R₄,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Olefin metathesis is an organic reaction involving the redistribution of olefin fragments by breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. It offers fewer by-products and hazardous wastes compared to alternative methods. Key catalysts include Schrock and Grubbs catalysts, essential for facilitating the reaction. Schrock catalysts are based on molybdenum(VI) and tungsten(VI) supported by alkoxide and imido ligands, while Grubbs catalysts utilize ruthenium(II) carbene complexes. 

Examples: 
The first two are examples of inorganic metathesis, which is a type of reaction where two compounds exchange cations and anions to form new products:

Reaction 1: HCl+NaOH→H2O+NaCl
In this reaction, hydrogen chloride reacts with sodium hydroxide to form water and sodium chloride.

Reaction 2: HCl+NH4F→HF+NH4Cl
Here, hydrogen chloride reacts with ammonium fluoride to produce hydrogen fluoride and ammonium chloride.

The final example shows a Wittig reaction, a specific type of organic metathesis used to form an alkene from an aldehyde or ketone. The image shows the formation of a phosphorus ylide from a phosphonium salt, which then reacts with a carbonyl compound to yield an alkene."
16,17,Cycloaddition Reaction,Formation of rings through simultaneous bond formation,[m+n] cycloaddition,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Cycloaddition reactions are chemical reactions in which two or more unsaturated molecules combine to form a cyclic adduct with altered bond multiplicity. These reactions are typically concerted and pericyclic, belonging to the class of addition reactions that do not require nucleophiles or electrophiles. Described using two notations, the older system uses parentheses for atom count, such as the Diels-Alder reaction as a (4+2)-cycloaddition. The IUPAC-preferred notation, introduced by Woodward and Hoffmann, uses square brackets to indicate electrons involved, such as the [4+2] notation for Diels-Alder and [3+2] for 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. These reactions are key in synthetic organic chemistry.

Example:
The reaction example shows how ethene and 1,3-butadiene combine to form cyclohexene.

The reaction can be written as:

CH2 = CH2 + CH2 = CH - CH = CH2 -> with heat at two hundred degrees Celsius -> C6 H10"
17,18,Coupling Reaction,"Two reactant molecules are bonded together, often with metal catalysts",R-M + R'-X → R-R' + M-X,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In the context of organic chemistry, a coupling reaction involves the bonding of two reactant molecules, typically facilitated by a metal catalyst. A prominent example is where an organometallic compound (R-M) reacts with an organic halide (R'-X) to form a new carbon–carbon bond. The most prevalent type is the cross-coupling reaction, recognized in the 2010 Nobel Prize awarded to Heck, Negishi, and Suzuki for their work on palladium-catalyzed cross coupling.

Examples:

1. The reaction shown is a Negishi cross-coupling. In this reaction, an allyl chloride and an ethylzinc chloride react in the presence of a palladium catalyst (Pd(PPh3)4) and a THF solvent.

The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the two reactant molecules, yielding a five-carbon alkene (pentene) and zinc chloride (ZnCl2).

The reaction can be described in text as:
Allyl chloride + Ethylzinc chloride  ( Catalist / Agent - Pd(PPh3)4,THF ) -> Pentene + ZnCl 2
​"
18,19,Free Radical Reaction,Reactions involving free radical intermediates,Initiation → Propagation → Termination,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A free radical reaction involves free radicals, often found in organic reactions. Key studies include the discovery of the triphenylmethyl radical and the lead-mirror experiment by Paneth, which demonstrated the creation and movement of methyl radicals. These reactions, prevalent in organic synthesis, are typically initiated by radical initiators like peroxides and follow a chain mechanism with initiation, propagation, and termination steps. Inhibitors can slow the reaction, while radical disproportionation presents a challenge. These reactions usually occur in the gas phase and are not heavily influenced by the medium's polarity.

Examples:
Reaction 1: Chlorine (C l 2) and methane (C H 4) react to form chloromethane (C H 3 C l) and hydrogen chloride (H C l). This needs ultraviolet light or heat to start.

Reaction 2: Chlorine (C l 2) and chloromethane (C H 3 C l) react to form dichloromethane (C H 2 C l 2) and hydrogen chloride (H C l). This also needs ultraviolet light or heat.

Reaction 3: Chlorine (C l 2) and dichloromethane (C H 2 C l 2) react to form trichloromethane (C H C l 3) and hydrogen chloride (H C l). Again, ultraviolet light or heat is required.

Reaction 4: Chlorine (C l 2) and trichloromethane (C H C l 3) react to form carbon tetrachloride (C C l 4) and hydrogen chloride (H C l). This reaction also requires ultraviolet light or heat."
19,20,Ring-Opening Reaction,Breaking of cyclic structures to form open-chain compounds,Cyclic → Open chain,https://byjus.com/chemistry/epoxide-reactions/,"The text discusses ring-opening reactions of epoxides, which are three-membered cyclic ethers with one oxygen atom. These rings have high ring tension due to the geometric strain, as the bond angles are 60° instead of the ideal 109.5° for sp³ hybridized atoms. This strain contributes to their reactivity with nucleophiles, despite the weak nature of oxygen as a leaving group. The ring-opening reaction is facilitated by this strain, making epoxides more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. In contrast, larger cyclic ethers do not undergo similar reactions under the same conditions due to reduced ring strain.

Examples:

Basic Ring-Opening
In this reaction, an asymmetric epoxide is opened using a basic reagent, sodium methoxide (NaOCH3). The methoxide ion (OCH 3−) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the less substituted carbon of the epoxide ring. This results in Product B, where the methoxy group (OCH3) is bonded to the less substituted carbon, and the hydroxyl group (OH) is bonded to the more substituted carbon.

Acidic Ring-Opening
In an acidic solution, the same epoxide is treated with an acid, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in methanol (CH3OH). The methanol molecule (CH3OH) acts as the nucleophile and attacks the more substituted carbon of the protonated epoxide ring. This results in the formation of product A where the methoxy group (OCH3) is bonded to the more substituted carbon, and the hydroxyl group (OH) is bonded to the less substituted carbon."
20,21,Ring-Closing Reaction,Formation of cyclic structures from open-chain precursors,Open chain → Cyclic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-closing_metathesis,"**Summary of Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM):**

Ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is an important reaction type in organic chemistry used for the synthesis of unsaturated rings through the intramolecular metathesis of two terminal alkenes, forming a cycloalkene and ethylene as by-products. Typically catalyzed by transition metals like Ru, Mo, and W, RCM is highly valued for its role in creating diverse ring sizes, commonly between 5-7 atoms, but extending to larger macrocycles. 

Examples:
n this reaction, a cyclic diene (a ring with two double bonds) reacts with a Grubbs-type catalyst or a similar metal carbene complex (represented as R-CH=M).

The reaction proceeds through a ring-closing metathesis mechanism. The metal carbene adds to one of the double bonds of the diene to form a four-membered metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then breaks apart, rearranging its bonds to form a new metal carbene and a new alkene, which in this case is a small, volatile alkene, often ethene (CH2=CH2), that is released from the reaction. The reaction continues with the new metal carbene attacking the second double bond on the ring, leading to the formation of a different metallacyclobutane intermediate. This second intermediate then breaks down to form a new, smaller cyclic alkene and a new metal carbene, which can then be released from the ring.

Ultimately, this results in the formation of a larger cyclic alkene with a new double bond and the release of a smaller alkene."
21,22,Complexation Reaction,Formation of coordination complexes between metal ions and ligands,M + nL → MLₙ,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In complexation reactions, multiple ligands interact with a metal atom to create a coordination complex. This process involves ligands donating their lone pairs to the empty orbitals of the metal atom, forming dipolar bonds. These ligands are Lewis bases and can be ions or neutral molecules such as carbon monoxide, ammonia, or water. The 18-electron rule is often applied to predict the number of ligands that bind to a central metal atom, signifying that the valence shells of a transition metal ideally accommodate 18 electrons. The symmetry and structure can be further analyzed using crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation also includes ligand exchange and redox processes that modify the oxidation state of the central metal atom.

Examples:
Here are some examples of complexation reactions [1-3]:

Adding a cobalt salt, such as cobalt chloride (CoCl2), to water (H2O)
CoCl2 (s) + 6 H2O (l) → [Co(H2O)6]2+ (aq.)

Adding copper sulfate (CuSO4) to water (H2O)
CuSO4 (s) + 6 H2O (l) → [Cu(H2O)6]2+ (aq.)

Adding aqueous ammonia (NH3) to [Cu(H2O)6]2+ replaces the water molecule
[Cu(H2O)6]2+ (aq.) + 4  NH3 (aq.) → [Cu(NH3)4]2+ (aq.)"
22,23,Ligand Substitution,Replacement of one ligand with another in a coordination complex,MLₙX + Y → MLₙY + X,https://utkaluniversity.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Inorg_React_Mech_NDas.pdf,"Transition metal complexes can exchange one ligand for another, and these reactions are important in their synthesis, stereochemistry, and catalytic chemistry. The mechanisms of chemical reactions are intimately connected to reaction kinetics. As in organic chemistry, the mechanisms of transition metal reactions are typically inferred from experiments that examine the concentration dependence of the incoming and outgoing ligands on the reaction rate, the detection of intermediates, and the stereochemistry of the reactants and products.

Thermodynamic vs. kinetics. When we think about the reactions of transition metal complexes, it is important to recall the distinction between their thermodynamics and kinetics. Take for example the formation of the square planar tetracyanonickelate complex:

Ni2+(aq)+4CN−(aq)=[Ni(CN)4]2−(aq)K(eq)≈1030M−4(5.12.1)

Thermodynamically, [Ni(CN)4]2- is very stable, meaning that the equilibrium above lies very far to the right. Kinetically, however, the complex is labile, meaning that it can exchange its ligands rapidly. For example the exchange between a 13C labeled CN- ion and a bound CN- ligand occurs on the timescale of tens of milliseconds:

[Ni(CN)4]2−(aq)+⋅CN−(aq)⟶[Ni(CN)3(⋅CN)]2−+CN−(aq)kexchange≈102M−1s−1(5.12.2)

Conversely, a compound can be thermodynamically unstable but kinetically inert, meaning that it takes a relatively long time to react. For example, the [Co(NH3)6]3+ ion is unstable in acid, but its hydrolysis reaction with concentrated HCl takes about one week to go to completion at room temperature:

[Co(NH3)6]3+(aq)+6H3O+(aq)⟶[Co(H2O)6]3+(aq)+6NH+4(aq)Keq≈1030(5.12.3)"
23,24,Electron Transfer Reaction,Transfer of electrons between inorganic complexes,Outer-sphere or Inner-sphere,https://utkaluniversity.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Inorg_React_Mech_NDas.pdf,"Electron transfer reactions (redox reactions) in transition metal complexes involve the transfer of an electron from one species to another, specifically between complexes. The reaction can be represented as: 

\[ \text{M}_1^{(x+)}\text{L}_n + \text{M}_2^{(y+)}\text{L}'_n \rightarrow \text{M}_1^{(x+1)+}\text{L}_n + \text{M}_2^{(y-1)+}\text{L}'_n \]

This involves -1 electron (oxidation) and +1 electron (reduction). These reactions are characterized by their rapidity, surpassing ligand exchange rates, and may not always involve ligand exchange. They play crucial roles in biological processes, particularly in metalloenzymes.

Examples:

In some cases, electron transfers occur much more quickly in the presence of certain ligands. For example, compare the rate constants for the following two electron transfer reactions, involving almost exactly the same complexes:

Co(NH3)3+6+Cr2+⟶Co2++Cr3++6NH3    (k=10−4M−1s−1)
 

Co(NH3)5Cl2++Cr2+⟶Co2++CrCl2++6NH3    (k=6×105M−1s−1)
 

(Note: aqua ligands are omitted for simplicity. Ions, unless noted otherwise, are aqua complexes.)

Notice two things: first, when there is a chloride ligand involved, the reaction is much faster. Second, after the reaction, the chloride ligand has been transferred to the chromium ion. Possibly, those two events are part of the same phenomenon."
24,25,Solid-State Reaction,Reactions occurring between solid reactants,Solid + Solid → Product,https://www.vedantu.com/question-answer/what-is-a-solidstate-reaction-class-11-chemistry-cbse-60c97714e5187b2947e21e3f,"Solid-state reactions occur without solvents, classified as mechanochemical processes. Reactants have limited contact and are typically ground, melted, or heated (around 1000-1500°C) to form polycrystalline inorganic solids. These reactions, also known as dry media or solventless reactions, are used in organic synthesis and metal alloy production (e.g., carbon steel, Fe-Ni). Key influencing factors include the chemical and morphological properties of reagents, reactivity, surface area, free energy changes, and reaction conditions like temperature and pressure. While they minimize chemical waste and cost, they may produce toxic byproducts and are not ideal for mass production.

Example:
MgO(s) + MoO₃(s) → MgMoO₄

This shows that magnesium oxide (MgO) in its solid state reacts with molybdenum trioxide (MoO₃), also in its solid state, to form magnesium molybdate (MgMoO₄)."

**Electrochemistry** is the study of the relationship between electrical energy and chemical changes, focusing on reactions that involve the input or generation of electric currents. Two main categories are **electrolysis** and **spontaneous redox reactions**.

**Electrochemical Cells** are devices where these reactions occur. They convert chemical energy into electrical energy (or vice versa) in a process where the Gibbs free energy decreases. There are two major types: **galvanic cells** and **electrolytic cells**.

**Galvanic Cells**:
- Convert chemical energy to electrical energy using redox reactions.
- Comprised of two compartments with separate oxidation and reduction sites.
- Example: The Daniell cell, where zinc and copper undergo a redox reaction.

**Reactions in a Daniell Cell**:
- **Overall Reaction**: Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺ + Cu(s)
- **At Anode (Oxidation)**: Zn(s) → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻
- **At Cathode (Reduction)**: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)

Historically, William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle expanded on Volta's work, observing gas production from water during electrolysis. The accompanying image depicts a Hofmann apparatus for this process.

1. Water (H₂O)

Water can undergo electrolysis in the presence of an electrolyte like acid or base. The presence of acid improves the electrical conductivity by increasing the hydrogen ion (H +) concentration.

Examples of such electrolytes are sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and the salt of sodium nitrate (NaNO3). The half-reactions are given below.

At cathode:
2 H+ (aq.) + 2 e− → H2 (g)

Hydrogen gas (H2) will be liberated at the cathode.

At anode: 2 H2O (l) → O2(g) + 4 H+(aq.) + 4 e−

Widely used in industries and decorative arts, electroplating enhances object qualities like abrasion resistance, corrosion resistance, and appearance. It's also employed in electronic applications such as printed circuit boards and copper purification. Throwing power impacts uniformity of the electroplated layer, influenced by solution composition and current density.

Example:
The reaction takes place in an electrolyte solution containing copper ions (Cu2+) and sulfate ions (SO42−). The process is as follows:

At the anode (Copper): Solid copper is oxidized, losing two electrons to form copper ions. These ions then dissolve into the electrolyte solution. Impurities settle at the bottom as anode mud. The half-reaction is: Cu(s) → Cu2+ (aq) + 2e−
 

At the cathode (Metal to be plated): Copper ions (Cu2+) from the solution are reduced, gaining two electrons to become solid copper. This solid copper then deposits onto the cathode's surface. The half-reaction is: 
Cu2+ (aq) + 2e− → Cu(s)

61,62,Wittig Reaction,Formation of alkenes from aldehydes/ketones and ylides,R₂C=O + Ph₃P=CR₂ → R₂C=CR₂,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittig_reaction,"The Wittig reaction, named after Georg Wittig, is a coupling reaction involving an aldehyde or ketone and a triphenyl phosphonium ylide to form an alkene. This reaction introduces a methylene group, enabling transformations such as the conversion of camphor to its methylene derivative. Most commonly, the reaction uses methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph₃P=CH₂) and typically occurs in solvents like THF or diethyl ether.

Mechanistically, unstabilized ylides form intermediates such as the oxaphosphetane, which evolves to the final alkene product. The stereochemistry of the reaction is influenced by conditions, notably lithium salts, which affect the stereochemical outcome. There is ongoing research into the interconversion of intermediates like betaine and the effects of stereochemical drift in the presence of lithium. This reaction is widely applicable for both aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes."
62,63,Heck Reaction,Palladium-catalyzed coupling of aryl halides with alkenes,ArX + alkene → Ar-alkene,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heck_reaction,"The Heck Reaction, also known as the Mizoroki-Heck reaction, is a chemical reaction involving the coupling of an unsaturated halide or triflate with an alkene in the presence of a base and a palladium catalyst to form a substituted alkene. Developed by Tsutomu Mizoroki and Richard F. Heck, it was a pioneering carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction, leading to a Nobel Prize for Heck in 2010. This reaction is comparable to other Pd(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions and serves as an alternative method to synthesize alkenes. 

Historically, Mizoroki's 1971 work detailed the coupling of iodobenzene and styrene using potassium acetate and palladium chloride at 120 °C, whereas Heck independently optimized the reaction conditions by adjusting the palladium-acetate catalyst and removing the solvent."
63,64,Suzuki Reaction,Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction,R-X + R'-B(OR)₂ → R-R',https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_reaction,"The Suzuki reaction, also known as Suzuki coupling, is an organic reaction that facilitates the cross-coupling of a boronic acid with an organohalide using a palladium complex catalyst. This reaction creates a carbon-carbon single bond, contributing to the formation of polyolefins, styrenes, and substituted biphenyls. First published by Akira Suzuki in 1979, it played a significant role in the Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded in 2010 to Suzuki, Richard F. Heck, and Ei-ichi Negishi. The reaction often involves a halide (R¹-X) and an organoboron compound (R²-BY₂) and utilizes a palladium catalyst and a base. It's an essential method for synthesizing complex molecules, often involving hydroboration or carboboration techniques. The Suzuki reaction is an important tool in the advancement of organic synthesis methodologies."
64,65,Chain Reaction,"Self-propagating reactions with initiation, propagation, and termination",Initiation → Propagation → Termination,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction,"**Chain Reaction Summary: Hydrogen-Bromine Reaction**

The hydrogen-bromine reaction is a chain reaction described by the equation \( \text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{HBr} \). It proceeds through a series of steps:

1. **Initiation**: 
   - \( \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{Br}^\cdot \) (thermal or photochemical).
   - Each Br atom is a free radical.

2. **Propagation** (cycle of two steps): 
   - \( \text{Br}^\cdot + \text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{HBr} + \text{H}^\cdot \)
   - \( \text{H}^\cdot + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow \text{HBr} + \text{Br}^\cdot \)
   - Overall, \( \text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{HBr} \).

3. **Retardation (inhibition)**: 
   - \( \text{H}^\cdot + \text{HBr} \rightarrow \text{H}_2 + \text{Br}^\cdot \)

4. **Termination**: 
   - \( 2 \text{Br}^\cdot \rightarrow \text{Br}_2 \)

The reaction follows the steady-state approximation, showing an initial fractional order of 3/2, with a complex rate equation involving mixed-order kinetics.

Additional examples include chain branching in \(\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}\) and chain-growth polymerization demonstrating further chain reaction dynamics."

Oscillating reactions are characterized by solutions to nonlinear differential equations, which can lead to oscillatory and chaotic behavior. A prominent example is the ""Iodine Clock Reaction."" This reaction involves iodine anions (\(I^-\)), which are colorless. When \(I^-\) is mixed with hydrogen peroxide (\(H_2O_2\)) and protons (\(H^+\)), it forms triiodide (\(I_3^-\)), displaying a dark blue color. The key reactions are:

1. \(H_2O_2 + 3 I^- + 2 H^+ \rightarrow I_3^- + 2 H_2O\)
2. \(I_3^- + 2 S_2O_3^{2-} \rightarrow 3 I^- + S_4O_6^{2-}\)

The rate laws are expressed as:

- \(d[I_3^-]/dt = k_1[I^-]^3 - k_2[I_3^-][S_2O_3^{2-}]^2\)
- Further differential equations describe the concentration changes over time.

The variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) represent concentrations of \(I^-\), \(I_3^-\), and \(S_2O_3^{2-}\), respectively, leading to simplified equations:

- \(dx/dt = -k_1x^3 + 3kyz^2\)
- \(dy/dt = k_1x^3 - kyz^2\)
- \(dz/dt = -kyz^2\)

These equations illustrate how small parameter changes can unpredictably affect the system's evolution, demonstrating the chaotic nature of the reaction."
66,67,Clock Reaction,Reactions with sudden color/property changes after delay,Delayed appearance of product,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_clock_reaction,"The Iodine Clock Reaction is a classic chemical demonstration of reaction kinetics, first described by Hans Heinrich Landolt in 1886. This reaction involves iodine species and redox agents with starch, leading to a distinct color change from colorless to dark blue after a delay. Variations include using different reagents like hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, and potassium iodide. In the described hydrogen peroxide variation, iodine is initially produced in a slow reaction, followed by a rapid reaction where thiosulfate reduces iodine back to iodide ions. When thiosulfate is consumed, iodine forms a complex with starch causing the blue color. Factors like pH and concentration can alter the reaction time. Cysteine can replace thiosulfate, with a similar process and result."
