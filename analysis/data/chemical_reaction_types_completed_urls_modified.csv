1,Synthesis/Combination Reaction,Two or more reactants combine to form a single product,A + B → AB,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A synthesis (or combination) reaction involves two or more simple substances combining to form a more complex compound, typically represented as \( A + B \rightarrow AB \). This type of reaction is characterized by multiple reactants yielding a single product. An example is the formation of iron(II) sulfide from iron and sulfur:

\[ 8 \text{Fe} + \text{S}_8 \rightarrow 8 \text{FeS} \]

Another example includes the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gases to produce water. Synthesis reactions are vital for forming complex molecules from simpler ones and are represented visually among four basic chemical reaction types: synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, and double replacement."
2,Decomposition Reaction,A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances,AB → A + B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A decomposition reaction involves a complex substance breaking down into simpler components, essentially the reverse of a synthesis reaction. It is represented as \( AB \rightarrow A + B \). An example is the electrolysis of water, where water (\(2H_2O\)) decomposes into oxygen (\(O_2\)) and hydrogen gas (\(2H_2\))."
3,Single Displacement/Substitution,A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound,A + BC → AC + B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In a single displacement reaction, an uncombined element replaces another in a compound, effectively exchanging places with an element within the compound. The general form of this reaction is \( A + BC \rightarrow AC + B \). An example is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water, forming solid magnesium hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas: \( \text{Mg} + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Mg(OH)}_2 + \text{H}_2 \)."
4,Double Displacement/Substitution,Two compounds exchange ions to produce two new compounds,AB + CD → AD + CB,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Double Displacement Reaction Summary:

In a double displacement reaction, the anions and cations of two compounds exchange places, resulting in the formation of two new compounds. The general form is: 

\[ AB + CD \rightarrow AD + CB \]

**Example 1:** When barium chloride (BaCl₂) reacts with magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄), the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻) exchanges with two chloride ions (2Cl⁻), forming barium sulfate (BaSO₄) and magnesium chloride (MgCl₂).

5,Combustion Reaction,"A substance reacts with oxygen, releasing energy as heat and light",CₓHᵧ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + energy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In a combustion reaction, an element or compound reacts with an oxidant, typically oxygen, producing energy as heat or light. Combustion commonly involves hydrocarbons. For example, the combustion of 1 mole (114 g) of octane (\( \text{C}_8\text{H}_{18} \)) in oxygen releases 5500 kJ and results in carbon dioxide and water: 

\[ \text{C}_8\text{H}_{18(l)} + \frac{25}{2} \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 8 \text{CO}_2(g) + 9 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \]

Other elements like carbon, magnesium, and sulfur can also undergo combustion:

\[ 2 \text{Mg}(s) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \text{MgO}(s) \]

\[ \text{S}(s) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{SO}_2(g) \]"
6,Acid-Base/Neutralization,An acid reacts with a base to produce salt and water,Acid + Base → Salt + Water,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory, an acid-base reaction involves the transfer of protons (H⁺) from an acid to a base. The acid loses a proton to form its conjugate base, while the base gains a proton to form its conjugate acid. The reaction is reversible, maintaining equilibrium determined by the acid and base dissociation constants (Kₐ and Kᵦ). A special case of this is neutralization, where equal amounts of acid and base form a neutral salt. Acid-base reactions can be defined by different theories: 

1. **Arrhenius**: Acids release H₃O⁺ ions in water; bases release OH⁻ ions.
2. **Brønsted-Lowry**: Acids are proton donors; bases are proton acceptors.
3. **Lewis**: Acids are electron-pair acceptors; bases are electron-pair donors. 

These definitions provide frameworks for understanding the nature and outcomes of acid-base interactions."
7,Precipitation Reaction,An insoluble solid (precipitate) forms when two aqueous solutions are mixed,AB + CD → AD(s) + BC,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A precipitation reaction involves forming a solid in a solution or within another solid during a chemical reaction, occurring when ion concentrations surpass the solubility limit, resulting in an insoluble salt. This reaction can be facilitated by adding a precipitating agent or removing the solvent. Rapid processes yield amorphous or microcrystalline residues, while slower ones produce single crystals, which can also form via recrystallization from microcrystalline salts."
8,Redox/Oxidation-Reduction,Oxidation and reduction occur together (electron transfer),Oxidation/Reduction,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions involve the transfer of electrons, where one species acts as a reducing agent and another as an oxidizing agent, resulting in changes in oxidation states. In the given reaction, hazardous sodium metal reacts with chlorine gas to form sodium chloride. Sodium is oxidized, losing an electron and increasing its oxidation state from 0 to +1, while chlorine is reduced, gaining an electron and decreasing its oxidation state from 0 to -1. Here, sodium acts as the reducing agent and chlorine as the oxidizing agent. This reaction exemplifies the core concepts of redox processes, with electron transfer leading to compound formation."
9,Addition Reaction,Two or more molecules combine to form a larger molecule (adduct),A=B + C → A-B-C,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"**Addition Reaction Summary**

Addition reactions involve the conversion of double or triple bonds into single bonds by adding atoms or groups to the carbon atoms involved in the unsaturation. They are a counterpart to elimination reactions, which involve removing substituents to form multiple bonds.

Key Steps:
1. **Electrophilic Addition**: A common addition mechanism where an electrophile initially attacks the π-bond of a double bond, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which is then attacked by a nucleophile. This is exemplified by the addition of hydrogen bromide (HBr) across a double bond, where H+ adds first to form a carbocation followed by the nucleophilic attack by Br-.

2. **Nucleophilic Addition**: Occurs frequently in carbonyl compounds. An example is the nucleophilic addition-elimination mechanism often seen in reactions involving carbonylic compounds.

3. **Markovnikov’s Rule**: In electrophilic additions to asymmetric alkenes, the electrophile attaches in such a way that the more stable carbocation is formed, often leading to the more substituted carbon becoming bonded to the electrophile.

Applications:
- Utilized in synthesizing crucial organic compounds, including alcohols, alkanes, and various substituted hydrocarbons.
- Important in polymerization processes, such as the formation of polymers via radical mechanisms.

Understanding addition reactions and their mechanisms, such as electrophilic and nucleophilic addition, is essential for predicting the outcomes of organic synthesis and reactivity."
10,Elimination Reaction,Two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one- or two-step mechanism,A-B-C → A=B + C,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"### Elimination Reaction Summary

**Reaction Type:** Elimination Reaction

Elimination reactions are processes that transform organic molecules by removing substituents, forming multiple bonds such as double or triple bonds. This involves the elimination of a leaving group and typically requires a base. There are two main types: 

1. **E1 Mechanism (Unimolecular Elimination):**
   - Involves two steps, starting with the formation of a carbocation as the leaving group is expelled.
   - A proton is then removed from the adjacent carbon, resulting in a double bond.
   - Competes with S_N1 substitution reactions.

2. **E2 Mechanism (Bimolecular Elimination):**
   - Occurs in a single step where the base attacks a proton simultaneously as the leaving group departs, forming a double bond without forming an intermediate.
   - Competes with S_N2 substitution reactions.
   - The anti-position attack is typical.

Elimination reactions are used for converting alkyl halides to alkenes and alkynes. The choice of base and the reaction conditions can dictate the formation of double or triple bonds and guide the reaction's regioselectivity.

**Additional Notes:**
- The electrostatic attack of a proton and Markovnikov's rule guide the regiochemistry in electrophilic addition of hydrogen halides.
- Nucleophilic addition-elimination mechanisms can also occur, particularly in aromatic compounds.
- Elimination reactions can produce more stable double bonds and are strategic in organic synthesis for constructing complex molecular architectures.

These details underscore the significance of base choice and mechanistic pathways in achieving desired structural transformations via elimination reactions."
11,Substitution Reaction,One functional group is replaced by another,A-B + C → A-C + B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In a substitution reaction, a functional group in a chemical compound is replaced by another group. This involves substituting species into nucleophilic, electrophilic, or radical substitution. 

1. **Nucleophilic Substitution:** A nucleophile with excess electrons replaces a part of the substrate. It commonly involves S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanisms. 
   - **S<sub>N</sub>1:** Two steps; slow formation of a carbocation, followed by nucleophile attack.
   - **S<sub>N</sub>2:** One-step back-side attack, leading to stereochemical inversion (Walden inversion).

2. **Electrophilic Substitution:** The species with positive charge (electrophile) substitutes into the aromatic system, commonly in aromatic hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of a σ-complex and subsequent restoration of aromaticity.

3. **Radical Substitution:** Involves radicals, often initiated by light or heat in a chain reaction, as seen in halogenation.

These reactions are pivotal in synthetic and industrial chemistry for creating complex molecules."
12,Pericyclic Reaction,Concerted reactions involving cyclic transition states,Cyclic mechanism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Pericyclic reactions are a class of organic reactions characterized by concerted cyclic movements of electrons. A key type is cycloaddition, where two or more double bond-containing molecules form a cyclic structure. An important example is the Diels–Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition, involving a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to produce a substituted cyclohexene. These transformations are noteworthy for their stereospecificity and the construction of complex cyclic systems, making them valuable for synthesis in organic chemistry."
13,Rearrangement Reaction,Atoms or groups migrate within a molecule to form structural isomers,A-B-C → A-C-B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A rearrangement reaction is a broad class of organic reactions characterized by a ""change of connectivity"" within a molecule. Typically intramolecular, these reactions often involve the movement of a substituent, such as in a 1,2-shift, where a group moves from one atom to an adjacent atom. An example includes the skeletal isomerization of n-butane to isobutane and pentane to isopentane. Common rearrangements include the Wagner–Meerwein and Beckmann rearrangements. These reactions are significant in industries like oil refining due to their role in converting straight-chain alkanes to branched isomers, which have better combustion properties for engines."
14,Photochemical Reaction,Reactions initiated or driven by light energy,A + hν → B,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Photochemical reactions involve atoms or molecules absorbing photons from light to reach an excited state. This surplus energy can break chemical bonds, forming radicals. Types include hydrogen-oxygen reactions, radical polymerization, chain reactions, and rearrangement reactions.

A notable example is photosynthesis, where solar energy converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose, releasing oxygen. Other applications include human vision, driven by the photochemical reaction of rhodopsin, and bioluminescence in fireflies triggered by an enzyme. Significant atmospheric photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry.

15,Diels-Alder Reaction,Cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and dienophile to form cyclohexene derivative,[4+2] cycloaddition,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"**Diels-Alder Reaction Summary:**

The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile, forming a substituted cyclohexene. This pericyclic reaction involves the interaction of pi orbitals forming new sigma bonds, leading to a cyclohexene derivative. In the provided image, the mechanism displays electron flow from the diene to the dienophile, resulting in a cyclic product. The orbital overlap illustration emphasizes the interaction between the p-orbitals of the diene and the dienophile's unsaturated system, transitioning to sp³ orbitals in the product. This reaction is stereospecific and concerted, meaning it occurs in a single step without intermediates, crucial for synthesizing complex cyclic structures in organic chemistry."
16,Olefin Metathesis,Exchange of double bonds between carbon atoms in alkenes,R₁-CH=CH-R₂ + R₃-CH=CH-R₄ → R₁-CH=CH-R₃ + R₂-CH=CH-R₄,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Olefin metathesis is an organic reaction involving the redistribution of olefin fragments by breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. It offers fewer by-products and hazardous wastes compared to alternative methods. Key catalysts include Schrock and Grubbs catalysts, essential for facilitating the reaction. Schrock catalysts are based on molybdenum(VI) and tungsten(VI) supported by alkoxide and imido ligands, while Grubbs catalysts utilize ruthenium(II) carbene complexes. This reaction revolutionized organic synthesis, and Schrock, Grubbs, and Chauvin received the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their contributions."
17,Cycloaddition Reaction,Formation of rings through simultaneous bond formation,[m+n] cycloaddition,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"Cycloaddition reactions are chemical reactions in which two or more unsaturated molecules combine to form a cyclic adduct with altered bond multiplicity. These reactions are typically concerted and pericyclic, belonging to the class of addition reactions that do not require nucleophiles or electrophiles. Described using two notations, the older system uses parentheses for atom count, such as the Diels-Alder reaction as a (4+2)-cycloaddition. The IUPAC-preferred notation, introduced by Woodward and Hoffmann, uses square brackets to indicate electrons involved, such as the [4+2] notation for Diels-Alder and [3+2] for 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. These reactions are key in synthetic organic chemistry."
18,Coupling Reaction,"Two reactant molecules are bonded together, often with metal catalysts",R-M + R'-X → R-R' + M-X,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In the context of organic chemistry, a coupling reaction involves the bonding of two reactant molecules, typically facilitated by a metal catalyst. A prominent example is where an organometallic compound (R-M) reacts with an organic halide (R'-X) to form a new carbon–carbon bond. The most prevalent type is the cross-coupling reaction, recognized in the 2010 Nobel Prize awarded to Heck, Negishi, and Suzuki for their work on palladium-catalyzed cross coupling.

Coupling reactions are classified into two types: 
1. **Homocouplings** - Join two identical partners resulting in a symmetrical product (R–R).
2. **Heterocouplings** - Join two different partners resulting in an unsymmetrical product (R–R').

The Ullmann reaction, an example of homocoupling, is depicted where two identical aryl halides (Ar-X) react using copper to form a biaryl product. Historical coupling reactions include:

- **Wurtz reaction (1855):** Uses sodium as a reductant in dry ether.
- **Pinacol coupling (1859):** Utilizes various metals requiring a proton donor.
- **Glaser coupling (1869):** Employs Cu with O₂ as the H-acceptor.
- **Ullmann reaction (1901):** Requires Cu and high temperatures.
- **Fittig reaction:** Similar to Wurtz but uses aromatic halides.
- **Scholl reaction (1910):** Uses NaAlCl₄ and high heat, with O₂ as an H-acceptor.

These reactions illustrate essential methods for constructing complex organic molecules through strategic carbon–carbon bond formation."
19,Free Radical Reaction,Reactions involving free radical intermediates,Initiation → Propagation → Termination,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"A free radical reaction involves free radicals, often found in organic reactions. Key studies include the discovery of the triphenylmethyl radical and the lead-mirror experiment by Paneth, which demonstrated the creation and movement of methyl radicals. These reactions, prevalent in organic synthesis, are typically initiated by radical initiators like peroxides and follow a chain mechanism with initiation, propagation, and termination steps. Inhibitors can slow the reaction, while radical disproportionation presents a challenge. These reactions usually occur in the gas phase and are not heavily influenced by the medium's polarity.

Kinetically, the reaction rate in a steady state depends on the concentration of initiating and terminating species, with a rate expressed as \( \text{rate} = k_{\text{obs}} [I]^{3/2} \), reflecting a broken-order dependence. Reactivity is influenced by bond types, with carbon-hydrogen bonds reacting in the order: primary < secondary < tertiary < benzylic < allylic, and stabilized through resonance and captodative effects."
20,Ring-Opening Reaction,Breaking of cyclic structures to form open-chain compounds,Cyclic → Open chain,https://byjus.com/chemistry/epoxide-reactions/,"The text discusses ring-opening reactions of epoxides, which are three-membered cyclic ethers with one oxygen atom. These rings have high ring tension due to the geometric strain, as the bond angles are 60° instead of the ideal 109.5° for sp³ hybridized atoms. This strain contributes to their reactivity with nucleophiles, despite the weak nature of oxygen as a leaving group. The ring-opening reaction is facilitated by this strain, making epoxides more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. In contrast, larger cyclic ethers do not undergo similar reactions under the same conditions due to reduced ring strain."
21,Ring-Closing Reaction,Formation of cyclic structures from open-chain precursors,Open chain → Cyclic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring-closing_metathesis,"**Summary of Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM):**

Ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is an important reaction type in organic chemistry used for the synthesis of unsaturated rings through the intramolecular metathesis of two terminal alkenes, forming a cycloalkene and ethylene as by-products. Typically catalyzed by transition metals like Ru, Mo, and W, RCM is highly valued for its role in creating diverse ring sizes, commonly between 5-7 atoms, but extending to larger macrocycles. 

The process was notably advanced by chemists Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock, who received the Nobel Prize for their contributions to olefin metathesis. Furthermore, RCM's efficiency and broad applicability make it a key method in green chemistry due to its atom economy. Ethylene is the main by-product, underscoring its environmentally conscious design. RCM remains a rich field for continued research and review."
22,Complexation Reaction,Formation of coordination complexes between metal ions and ligands,M + nL → MLₙ,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction,"In complexation reactions, multiple ligands interact with a metal atom to create a coordination complex. This process involves ligands donating their lone pairs to the empty orbitals of the metal atom, forming dipolar bonds. These ligands are Lewis bases and can be ions or neutral molecules such as carbon monoxide, ammonia, or water. The 18-electron rule is often applied to predict the number of ligands that bind to a central metal atom, signifying that the valence shells of a transition metal ideally accommodate 18 electrons. The symmetry and structure can be further analyzed using crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation also includes ligand exchange and redox processes that modify the oxidation state of the central metal atom. An example of such a complex is Ferrocene, which features an iron atom coordinated between two cyclopentadienyl ligands."
23,Ligand Substitution,Replacement of one ligand with another in a coordination complex,MLₙX + Y → MLₙY + X,https://utkaluniversity.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Inorg_React_Mech_NDas.pdf,"**Summary of Ligand Substitution Reaction: Associative Mechanism**

The reaction involves nucleophilic substitution via an associative (A) \(S_N2\) mechanism, characterized by the formation of an intermediate with a higher coordination number (CN) than the reactant. The mechanism consists of two steps:

1. Formation of Intermediate: 
   \[
   ML_5X + Y \rightarrow ML_5XY 
   \]
   This step is slow and the intermediate is rarely isolatable.

2. Release of Leaving Group: 
   \[
   ML_5XY \rightarrow ML_5Y + X 
   \]
   This step is fast.

The reaction pathway features a narrow transition state (TS) with a negative entropy change (\(\Delta S\)). The kinetic expression for these associative reactions is defined as:
\[ 
\frac{d[ML_5Y]}{dt} = \frac{k_1k_2[ML_5X][Y]}{k_{-1} + k_2}
\]
The intermediate and transition state structures can be Capped Octahedral and Penta Bipyramidal. Such reactions are critical for understanding kinetics and mechanisms in coordination chemistry."
24,Electron Transfer Reaction,Transfer of electrons between inorganic complexes,Outer-sphere or Inner-sphere,https://utkaluniversity.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Inorg_React_Mech_NDas.pdf,"Electron transfer reactions (redox reactions) in transition metal complexes involve the transfer of an electron from one species to another, specifically between complexes. The reaction can be represented as: 

\[ \text{M}_1^{(x+)}\text{L}_n + \text{M}_2^{(y+)}\text{L}'_n \rightarrow \text{M}_1^{(x+1)+}\text{L}_n + \text{M}_2^{(y-1)+}\text{L}'_n \]

This involves -1 electron (oxidation) and +1 electron (reduction). These reactions are characterized by their rapidity, surpassing ligand exchange rates, and may not always involve ligand exchange. They play crucial roles in biological processes, particularly in metalloenzymes."

Reactants have limited contact and are typically ground, melted, or heated (around 1000-1500°C) to form polycrystalline inorganic solids. These reactions, also known as dry media or solventless reactions, are used in organic synthesis and metal alloy production (e.g., carbon steel, Fe-Ni). Key influencing factors include the chemical and morphological properties of reagents, reactivity, surface area, free energy changes, and reaction conditions like temperature and pressure. While they minimize chemical waste and cost, they may produce toxic byproducts and are not ideal for mass production."

**Electrochemistry** is the study of the relationship between electrical energy and chemical changes, focusing on reactions that involve the input or generation of electric currents. Two main categories are **electrolysis** and **spontaneous redox reactions**.

**Electrochemical Cells** are devices where these reactions occur. They convert chemical energy into electrical energy (or vice versa) in a process where the Gibbs free energy decreases. There are two major types: **galvanic cells** and **electrolytic cells**.

**Galvanic Cells**:
- Convert chemical energy to electrical energy using redox reactions.
- Comprised of two compartments with separate oxidation and reduction sites.
- Example: The Daniell cell, where zinc and copper undergo a redox reaction.

**Reactions in a Daniell Cell**:
- **Overall Reaction**: Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) → Zn²⁺ + Cu(s)
- **At Anode (Oxidation)**: Zn(s) → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻
- **At Cathode (Reduction)**: Cu²⁺(aq) + 2e⁻ → Cu(s)

Electrochemical reactions can also require electrical energy to proceed, as seen in electrolytic cells."

Key to this process is the decomposition potential, the minimum voltage needed. The term ""electrolysis,"" introduced by Michael Faraday in 1834, combines Greek roots meaning ""amber"" (linked to electrical phenomena) and ""dissolution."" Historically, William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle expanded on Volta's work, observing gas production from water during electrolysis. The accompanying image depicts a Hofmann apparatus for this process."

This reaction involves iodine species and redox agents with starch, leading to a distinct color change from colorless to dark blue after a delay. Variations include using different reagents like hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, and potassium iodide. In the described hydrogen peroxide variation, iodine is initially produced in a slow reaction, followed by a rapid reaction where thiosulfate reduces iodine back to iodide ions. When thiosulfate is consumed, iodine forms a complex with starch causing the blue color. Factors like pH and concentration can alter the reaction time. Cysteine can replace thiosulfate, with a similar process and result."
