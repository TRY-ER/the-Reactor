The methoxide ion (OCH3−) serves as the nucleophile and preferentially attacks the less substituted carbon of the epoxide ring due to steric reasons. This nucleophilic attack leads to the opening of the three-membered ring, resulting in Product B, where the methoxy group (OCH3) is attached to the less substituted carbon, and the hydroxyl group (OH) is attached to the more substituted carbon. This regioselectivity is characteristic of basic conditions for unsymmetric epoxides.', 'In this acidic ring-opening reaction, the same asymmetric epoxide is treated with an acid, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), in methanol (CH3OH). The epoxide is first protonated, making it more electrophilic, and then the methanol molecule (CH3OH) acts as the nucleophile, attacking the more substituted carbon of the protonated epoxide ring.

Typically catalyzed by transition metals like Ru, Mo, and W, RCM is highly valued for its role in creating diverse ring sizes, commonly between 5-7 atoms, but extending to larger macrocycles. In this reaction, a cyclic diene (a ring with two double bonds) reacts with a Grubbs-type catalyst or a similar metal carbene complex (represented as R-CH=M). The reaction proceeds through a ring-closing metathesis mechanism. The metal carbene adds to one of the double bonds of the diene to form a four-membered metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate then breaks apart, rearranging its bonds to form a new metal carbene and a new alkene, which in this case is a small, volatile alkene, often ethene (CH2=CH2), that is released from the reaction. The reaction continues with the new metal carbene attacking the second double bond on the ring, leading to the formation of a different metallacyclobutane intermediate. This second intermediate then breaks down to form a new, smaller cyclic alkene and a new metal carbene, which can then be released from the ring. Ultimately, this results in the formation of a larger cyclic alkene with a new double bond and the release of a smaller alkene.']","[['C=CCCCC=C', 'C1=CCCC1', 'C=C']]",['C=CCCCC=C>>C1=CCCC1.C=C'],['[C]=[C]CCCC=[C]>>[C]1=CCCC1.[C]=[C]'],['[C:1]=[C:2][C:3][C:4][C:5][C:6]=[C:7]>>[C:1]=[C:7].[C:2]1=[C:6][C:5][C:4][C:3]1']
